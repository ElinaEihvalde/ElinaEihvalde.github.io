                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>For this assignment we were working with Wicked problem - Environmental threats. We had to come
                        up with a concept that could be solved with digital media. From conducted
                        research we decided to focus on: “ Awareness and individual impact on the environment - how can
                        we make the environment more personal and how can we show people how they impact the nature
                        with their behavior?”.

                    <h4>Step 01</h4>
                    <h3>Empathise</h3>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>We started by researching the environment problem and how people relate to it. Combining
                        research and personal experiences we
                        came up with a hypothesis -"
                        People are aware of the threats, but lose interest in protecting the environment as they
                        are not able to see how they individually impact the environment
                        and what action to take".
                    </p>
                </div>



                <div class="description-box fadeInUp-scroll">
                    <h4>Step 03</h4>
                    <h3>Ideate</h3>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>We worked with the Design Thinking method and came up with several questions we had to answer to
                        come up with a full concept, and we did that using the “Idea String”. We wrote all ideas, silly or good, on sticky notes.
                        Afterward, we read through all of the ideas and tried to combine them, looking for the best
                        possible answers to our questions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="description-box fadeInUp-scroll">
                    <h4>Step 05</h4>
                    <h3>IA and sketches</h3>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>The goal was to make a user-friendly app with clear navigation, therefore, we used card sorting to
                        categorize the content.
                        After IA was done we began to create the layout. As wanted to implement swiping function to
                        make the journey pleasant we came up with a design that would support the vertical and horizontal
                        swiping.

                    <h3>Focus group interview</h3>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p> The hypothesis was confirmed and additionally, we found out that people are more likely to do
                        something if they see their friends being active. Also, they like to follow trending challenges
                        and competitions and they want to be reminded about saving the resources and money.

                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>As we were working with a concept first, product second mindset, we had to find out if users are
                        interested in our solution - app. We created a short pitch to test the idea, gain feedback and
                        more ideas on
                        what functionalities and options the app should include and what would motivate to use the product.</p>

                    <p>When the sketches were done, we create high fidelity prototypes in terms of design. These
                        prototypes are functional to some extent demonstrating the functionality and transition. We
                        worked with design trends, emphasizing the visual experience with HD images and added gesture
                        suggestions to help with interaction. </p>

                <h3>Final prototype</h3>
                <p>We create a prototype for an app that would encourage people to take action in order to help the
                    environment. This would be achieved with different challenges where users could compete with friends to see who leaves the less carbon footprint. When participating in challenges the user would get notifications or tips based on their daily routine to help them succeed. In addition to
                    that, the user would be able to connect to their utility providers and see how much energy and water they use and what carbon footprint that leaves and how can they help the environment by
                    saving money.</p>
