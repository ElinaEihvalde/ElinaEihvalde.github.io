                    <p>The focus was to create an official website for an online community that has gained more than 10k
                        followers in the last year. As Slovakfolklore was on several social media platforms they needed
                        one platform that would increase the Association's credibility, broaden the community and
                        showcase their ideas and values as well as inform the community about the latest Slovak folklore
                        events all around the world.

                    <p>We started by understanding how #SLOVAKFOLKORE works what are the needs and who are the users.
                        At this point, I created a project and time plan that was followed throughout the project. </p>

                    <p>We conducted interviews where we learned about user personal relation with their country's
                        traditions, how they understand globalization and their opinion on the combination of the
                        traditions with the modern culture.</p>

                    <p>We created hi-fi visual and prototypes with some functionality in Adobe Xd. We worked with
                        semiotics, color theory and tried working with Material design. This was the final design stage
                        before starting the development process. </p>

                    <p>To understand what #SLOVAKFOLKORE's users are most interested in, we created a  survey which

                    <p>The design process started with brainstorming to create different layout options that were based
                        on research. This phase was stating point for prototyping where we gained feedback and refined
                        the product.

                    <p>For this project I was responsible for the development process. We created a responsive website
                        by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. As the requirements forbid to use any 3rd party code
                        it was challenging but I learned a lot about working with JavaScript had to learn a lot to
                        implement functionality.

                <h3>Final prototype</h3>
                <p>en developing this website we tried to combine modern UI elements with a traditional theme, moreover
                    we worked with semiotics and created adaptions of Slovak national colors. We created a prototype
                    for a platform where the organization's followers could learn about upcoming events, read about
                    different folk groups and contact them. To achieve this we created a simple filtration function so
                    users could separate the ensembles by region, alphabetically and by type, but events by type and
                    month. </p>
